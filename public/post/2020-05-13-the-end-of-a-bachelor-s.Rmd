This is it. 4 years of long nights and stressing has finally come to a close. I have one more thing in front of me and that is a final for one class. I am so excited. I am nervous. But I am also sad.

COVID-19 ruined my senior year, just like many others but I know there is a bgger and better plan that God has in store.
