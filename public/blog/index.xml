      <description>As I sit on my backyard patio watching sunday golf and thinking about what the past 5 months has been like, I begin to smile. Sarcastically, maybe, but I would also like to think there was a reason for this time. We are currently facing a global pandemic that has taken the lives of millions, and the United States seems to be the only country that has yet to get it under control.</description>

      <description>Everyone meet Zeke, my 2 year old fox red labrador. Yes, he has oddly beautiful human eyes and a pink nose, unlike most labradors. Being curious traits for a labrador of his type, I had to do some research. Turns out, my son is a rare type of lab called a Dudley. The Dudley trait, most common to labradors, is essentially albinism for dogs in which they do not have pigment in their nose and their eyes tend to be a yellow or greenish hue.</description>

      <description>Imagine you are sitting at your desk working through R studio and your mind begins wandering away. You start to think about what life would be like out of school, and begin to fantasize over your hopes and dreams. The nerd in me, however, begins to think about how R and Python can communicate with each other and how I could make that work.
Well, I am in luck because if you go online and listen to your professor who knows a lot (at least mine does), you’ll come to realize that this isn’t a very difficult task.</description>
