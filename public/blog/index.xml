      <description>Everyone meet Zeke, my 2 year old fox red laborador. Yes, he has beautiful human eyes and a pink nose, unlike most laboradors. Just as curious as you may be, I had to do some research. Turns out, my son is a certain kind of laborador called Dudley. Dudley is essentially albinism in dogs, most common among laboradors, which they do not have the pigment in their nose to be dark and their eyes tend to be yellow or green.</description>
